# Given a list of filenames, we want to rename all the files with extension hpp to the extension h. To do this, we would like to generate a new list called newfilenames, consisting of the new filenames. Fill in the blanks in the code using any of the methods youâ€™ve learned thus far, like a for loop or a list comprehension.

# txt = "The rain in Spain"
# x = re.search("^The.*Spain$", txt)
# if x:
#   print("YES! We have a match!")
# else:
#   print("No match")
